## Package Collection for Faster Web Development

Sail is a collection of packages that help in creating web applications.
It is intended to remove boilerplate code and handle typical tasks that
nearly all web applications need to do, such as the creation and
management of session cookies, user login and credential validation as
well as database handling.
