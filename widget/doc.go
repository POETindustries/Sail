// Package widget is a collection of small pieces of software that can
// be embedded into a web page. They perform specific tasks or hold
// specific information or functionality.
//
// There are several types of widgets, each designed to fulfill more
// or less specific tasks.
//
// Menu
//
// On a usual webpage, menus are probably the most common widgets.
// They display a list of clickable elements, each directing the user
// to another location.
//
// Sail's menus currently don't support submenus.
//
// Text Field
//
// Text fields are generally used to convey a compact amount of
// information that should be displayed in more than one location
// and at the same time does not really fit well within the contents
// of any one page. Contact information in the sidebar is one typical
// use case for a text field widget.
